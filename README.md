# Research
This is where we document our learning.

Please create a markdown file with your research in named using kebab-case. Place it in the appropriate week-X folder (e.g. week-1) and then link to it from this README file.

Any extra resources you find and think would be useful to your cohort add to the extra resources section with links to appropriate websites or markdown files.
