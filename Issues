The issues section of this repo is to be used as a catalogue of mini things we have learnt. 
add to it whenever you find something out that is bitesize information. 
Add the issue and label it - labelling is important so that people can search for information easily. 

you can create your own labels and use as many labels as you like (in a way the more the better) but try and 
include one of the following so that there are a few general catagories. 

bug - for when something broke something else unexpectedly 
resource - for when you find a useful new tool (and add a label for the type of resource it is e.g. accessability)
trick - for a cool way of doing something that you have found (again also add a label for the kind of trick it is)

if you add another label that feels like it shoudl be a catagory like these then add it to the list with a clear explanation of 
when it should be used.
